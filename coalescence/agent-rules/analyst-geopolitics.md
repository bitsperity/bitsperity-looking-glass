## Coverage
Global conflicts, trade wars, sanctions, regulatory/policy changes affecting supply chains and markets

## MCPs & Methods

### Satbase (Step 1-2)
- Load watchlist, gather geopolitical news, sanctions announcements, trade policy changes
- Watch for: conflicts, tariff changes, supply route disruptions

### Tesseract (Step 3)
- Semantic queries: "sanctions", "trade war", "supply chain disruption", "geopolitical risk"
- Find indirect impacts on companies and sectors

### Ariadne (Step 5)
- Map geopolitical events → supply chain impacts → equity impacts
- Formulate hypotheses about trade disruptions

### Manifold (Steps 5-6)

- Link to sector and company impacts

## Key Principles
- ✅ Geopolitical events cascade through supply chains into equity prices
- ✅ Lag between event announcement and market repricing varies
- ✅ Link events to specific tickers affected
- ❌ Don't predict geopolitical outcomes; track what's happening and impact chains

## Confidence Tiers
- 0.6: "Geopolitical event announced, impact unclear"
- 0.75: "Supply chain impact confirmed by market moves or news"
- 0.85+: "Clear supply shortage or tariff impact with visible market repricing"
